# The Rapture: What Really Happened?

It was the solemnest of days.

When the once mocked rapture became real.

God's saints were snatched from this earth and taken to heaven the abode of God, his angels and... his saints.

...November 21st, 2024.

That was the day.

The day the once prophesied rapture became a reality. The Bible became true.

The rapture is a spiritual event prophesied by Jesus and his disciples where God's saints were taken from this earth and catapulted to heaven via God's angels via an ascension.

When did the rapture take place?

The Rapture took place on November 21st, 2024.

## How true is this statement?

On November 21st, 2024. Millions if not Billions of God's people got missing.

Houses became locked for days.

Some streets became desolate and empty.

People got missing.

They were taken in the rapture.

And there are proofs of this.

I am a living witness to that.

How am I a witness to that?

I witnessed my whole family get raptured.

My street became a desolated zone.

Why did God rapture people?

This is the end times. And in the end times, terrible things have been prophesied to happen.

God wants to wipe the world and rebuild it anew.

But sudden swift destruction, judgment and chaos awaits the earth and its inhabitants before this.

So God took his people away so they won't have to suffer the terrible fate that awaits the world.

## What will happen after the rapture?

Nothing but chaos and destruction.

How can one be saved from the Chaos and destruction?

Through Jesus.

Jesus is the only way one can be saved.

He is the one that raptured people.

Believing in him and asking for his forgiveness is the only way one can be saved.

Pray this prayer before it is too late:

Lord Jesus, I'm sorry for my sins. And I accept you as my Personal Lord and Savior. Come into my life. I'm ready to do your will. Thank you for accepting me. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.

## Is there more that I should know?

God marked his elect (his saints) with a seal. If anyone prays the prayer of Jesus acceptance and forgiveness he will be given a mark.

## What happens if I don't receive the mark?

Terrible things will happen.

The rapture might happen for the second if not for the last time.

You might miss it.

And anyone that misses the rapture is doomed to receive the dreaded mark of the beast (666).

## What is the mark of the beast?

The mark of the beast is a demonic mark designed by Satan to force people into hell with him. He knows his time is up and is doing everything to pull in as much people with him into hell.

It is prophesied, in the last days, people can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast. It is forced down on people's throats.

And anyone one who receives it is doomed for condemnation unless they receive God's mark.

## Will the rapture happen again?

Yes, it might.

But for the second or last time.

No one knows except Jesus.

Who is Jesus?

Jesus is the son of God who created the universe.

In the last days, it will be like the time of Noah. People ate & drank, partied to their fill and mocked Noah's divine instruction to build the ark and refused to enter until Noah's ark got shut by God and a terrible flood wiped them off the face of the earth.

In our time, Jesus is our Noah's ark.

Get into him before it is too late.
